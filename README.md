# spam-classification
A python classifier for spam detection 

<h1> Prerequisites: </h1>
I would highly recommend that before the hack night you have some kind of toolchain and development environment already installed and ready. If you have no idea where to start with this, try a combination like:

Python
scikit-learn / sklearn
Pandas
NumPy
matplotlib

<h1> Dataset: </h1>
The SMS/Email Spam Collection is a set of SMS tagged messages that have been collected for SMS/Email Spam research. It contains one set of SMS messages in English of 5,567 messages, tagged according being ham (legitimate) or spam.

You can collect raw dataset from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ShubhamPy/Spam-Classifier/master/spam.tsv 


The files contain one message per line. Each line is composed by two columns:

Class- contains the label (ham or spam)
Message - contains the raw text.
